Hi
This is a project that should probably help me not to get to rusty with programming. I'll post solutions to challenges from Project Euler webpage - https://projecteuler.net/. I'm not a mathematician and I'm aiming to tackle some mathematical problems.
Also, just to use and polish my Python skills.

Yours faithfully
f.
